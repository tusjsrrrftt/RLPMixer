RLPMixer

🚀 Overview

RLPMixer is a cutting-edge image generation framework that blends Reinforcement Learning (RL) with pixel-wise iterative refinement. Instead of generating entire images at once, RLPMixer progressively "mixes" and "locks" pixels using a reward-based system — mimicking how puzzles are solved piece by piece.

✨ Key Features

Reinforcement Learning Core: Utilizes reward signals to guide pixel or patch generation.

Iterative Refinement: Dynamically generates, validates, and locks pixels in real-time.

Noisy Label Handling: Built-in mechanisms to deal with imperfect labels using attention and confidence scoring.

Seed-Based Randomization: Ensures reproducibility by controlling initial pixel guesses.

Scalable Architecture: Supports batch processing of pixel patches for efficiency.

📚 How It Works

Layered Architecture:

Dataset Layer: Acts as the reference layer (ground-truth pixels).

Model Layer: Generates pixels iteratively.

Training Mid-Layer: Validates generated pixels and provides feedback.

Training Process:

The model guesses pixel values (RGB).

Correct guesses receive a reward and are locked.

Incorrect guesses adjust through trial-and-error, refining over time.

🏆 Use Cases

Dynamic Art Generation: Interactive, evolving artworks.

Puzzle Solving AI: Automates games like jigsaw puzzles and Picross.

Medical Image Reconstruction: Refines corrupted scans through learned patterns.

Steganography: Embeds hidden data within pixel arrangements.
