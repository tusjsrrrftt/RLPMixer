# RLPMixer
RLPMixer is an innovative image generation framework that combines Reinforcement Learning (RL) with pixel-wise iterative refinement. Instead of generating images all at once, RLPMixer progressively "mixes" and "locks" pixels through a reward-based system â€” mimicking how a puzzle is solved piece by piece.
